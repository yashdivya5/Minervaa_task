# Student Performance Predictor API

A machine learning-based API that predicts student performance based on historical marks and attendance data. This project uses Python, FastAPI, and scikit-learn to create a predictive model that can be easily integrated into educational applications.

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict student performance and identify learning trends. The system uses historical academic data including:
- Previous semester marks
- Attendance records
- Performance trends

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- Docker
- Joblib

## Local Setup
